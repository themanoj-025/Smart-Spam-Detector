# Smart-Spam-Detector — Documentation Folder Cleanup & De-LLM-ification Audit (2026-08-15)

## 1. Executive Summary

Scope: full `docs/` tree — root docs, `community/` (incl. SUPPORT.md),
`design/`, `product/`, `project/`, `reference/`, `technical/`, `migration/`,
`audit/`. Docs are project-specific and terse. Reads as human-curated. No Tier
0/1 actions required.

## 2. Urgent: Leaked Secrets/Credentials Found

None.

## 3. LLM/AI Fingerprints Removed

None. The `TechSpec.md` `staging.example.com` / `spam.example.com` entries are
placeholder hostnames in a deployment-environment table — flag only (see §14),
not auto-removed (they document an intended deployment shape).

## 4. Structural Changes

None.

## 5. Duplicate Content Consolidated

None. No identical files, no same-basename collisions.

## 6. Contradictions Found (manual review, not auto-resolved)

None.

## 7. Boilerplate/Template Cruft Removed

None.

## 8. Dead Links Fixed/Removed

None. Link scanner clean.

## 9. README / CONTRIBUTING / CONSTITUTION Review

No `docs/README.md` index; top-level docs serve as entry points (acceptable).

## 10. Security/Privacy Findings

None.

## 11. Consistency Fixes Applied

None required.

## 12. Files Modified

- `docs/audit/cleanup-audit-2026-08-15.md` — added (this report)

## 13. Files/Folders Deleted

None.

## 14. Remaining Manual Review Items

1. **Placeholder hostnames in `technical/TechSpec.md` (Tier 2)** —
   `staging.example.com` / `spam.example.com` are example domains in the
   environment table. If real hostnames exist, replace them; if the table is
   illustrative, add a note saying so. Owner decision.
2. **No docs index (Tier 2 recommendation)** — optional `docs/README.md`.

## 15. "Does This Still Look AI-Scaffolded?" Score

**98 / 100** — 100 baseline; −2 for the example-domain hostnames in the
deployment table and the optional index. No contradictions, no empty folders.
